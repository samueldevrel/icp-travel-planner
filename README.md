# `travel_planner ai`

This is an innovative travel planning solution powered by Google's Gemini AI . This intelligent system helps travelers discover destinations, plan itineraries, and manage their entire travel experience through natural conversations and personalized recommendations.

To get started, 
```
git clone https://github.com/samueldevrel/icp-travel-planner
cd icp-travel-planner

npm install
```

Get your google gemini api key then

```
 cd src/travel_planner_frontend

touch .env

add your api key by naming it
API_KEY=""

```


## Running the project 


```bash
# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --background

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
dfx deploy
```

Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.

If you have made changes to your backend canister, you can generate a new candid interface with

```bash
npm run generate
```

at any time. This is recommended before starting the frontend development server, and will be run automatically any time you run `dfx deploy`.

If you are making frontend changes, you can start a development server with

```bash
npm start
```

Which will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 4943.

### Note on frontend environment variables

If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:

- set`DFX_NETWORK` to `ic` if you are using Webpack
- use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` in the autogenerated declarations
  - Setting `canisters -> {asset_canister_id} -> declarations -> env_override to a string` in `dfx.json` will replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` with the string in the autogenerated declarations
- Write your own `createActor` constructor
